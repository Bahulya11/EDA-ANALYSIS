1.Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.

2.Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).

3.Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.

4.Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

5.Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

6.Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.
